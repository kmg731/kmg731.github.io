# Welcome

Hello!  This is the first post on my blog.  I've got lots of cool projects planned that should be fun to read about.
I'm still playing around with the HTML/CSS of this site and the layout may change a bit in the next few weeks. There
are still some bugs I want to work out before I start posting regularly, but the actual content will be on the way
in the next few weeks.  

I've been able to get everything to play nicely so far.  I switched from hosting this on Blogger to Github pages and
I'm loving the functionality and control that jekyll provides for blogs.  Everything seems to be working nicely (except
for one minor issue with markdown exporting in org-mode).

Thanks for reading!
