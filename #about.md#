Hello!  This is my own personal blog that I use to keep track of all the programming stuff I do.  I'm a hobbyist 
programmer and I started taking programming seriously around September 2019.  Unfortunately, this was in my last 
semester of senior year, so there was no way I could take any real CS classes or change my major in that time.

Most of the posts on here will concern project diaries and things that I find interesting in Computer Science.  From
time to time, I may also post about topics relating to translation, linguistics and language learning.  I really love
learning languages and I think it's alwasy cool to learn more about how they work, or the interesting things that they
each have.

There are a few things that I want to focus on whenever I post anything here.

1. I'd like to teach but I'd like to show what kind of process I go through when I work on these projects.  It's useful
to have someone just explain how to do something but I think it's more beneficial if you can see what someone found 
interesting/difficult when making something.  It shows that we all make mistakes and don't really know everything 
when we first start on something.
