* Post Ideas

** +Vigenere Cipher+
Basically finished.  Needs some editing, a bit of cleanup and a few features better tested, but it all works well.

** Learning Rust and building something
I've wanted to play around with rust for a bit and this seems like a good time to dip my toes into it.
I can build some introductory projects and see what's up in the rust world.  

** Audio visualizer in C
I've already got the code for this, it wouldn't be very difficult to go back, clean it up, and 
get it to work really well.  I could also hook it into something a bit nicer (maybe a microcontroller)
and get that working

** Simple 2D platformer engine 
Something simple, like the engine needed to make an NES game like contra or something like that.  I think platformers
are pretty cool and it would be fun to try to make my own, even if the art and assets are primative. 
I'll have to find some free pixel art editor or something (maybe like the free build of aesprite, or just buy it for
$15) and get everything together to make something cool.
It shouldn't be that hard since it is only 2d.  I don't have to worry about shaders or anything like that. 

** Gentoo/Thinkpad setup
Hopefully if I get one for christmas, I can make something about how I threw libreboot on it, installed gentoo
and set everything up to work nicely.
** Chip-8 emulator
Finally try to figure this thing out and get it working.  Actually do it right for once and try 
to find a more standard/scalable way to handle the opcodes.  Also take the time to learn what the
opcodes are actually doing instead of just copying code from wikipedia.  
I'll have to read up on assembly to do this.

** Sudoku solver in C
Port over the sudoku solver from the java class into C.  This might be more difficult since it will handle
recursive backtracking in C and reading in/filling from a file doesn't seem as straightforward as in Java,
but I might be pleasantly surprised.

** Mathematic Expression evaluator
Take from the data structures and algorithms in Java book and actually make it for once.  Do it either only in C, or
use it as a pet project to try out new langauges.  This isn't meant to be any kind of fancy programming
language thing, just a small toy to evaluate expressions.

** Some other fun data structure-focused projects
Read through some data structure books and see what looks cool.\

- Towers of Hanoi
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Game AI decision trees?
  - Don't try a chess engine, thats just....way too much
- Binary tree focused problems/projects
- Stack focused problems/projects

** Something on Recursion 
I still don't think I've wrapped my head entirely around recursion, so making something about it and how it's used
in various projects might be helpful to actually get a solid grasp on the concept and how it's used in different languages
and situations.  
The core is always the same, but the implementation is always the mind bender.
