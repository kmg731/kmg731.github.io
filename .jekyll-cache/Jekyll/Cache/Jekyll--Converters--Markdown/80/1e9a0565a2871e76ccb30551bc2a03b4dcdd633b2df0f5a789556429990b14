<p>Hello!  This is my own personal blog that I use to keep track of all the programming stuff I do.</p>

<p>Most of the posts on here will be project diaries and things that I find interesting in Computer Science.  From
time to time, I may also post about topics relating to translation, linguistics and language learning.  I really love
learning languages and I think it’s always cool to learn more about how they work, or the interesting things that they
each have.  My biggest goal with this is to just document the stuff I’m working on or interested in at any given time.</p>

<p>My main goal with this is to teach anyone reading how to do something, but also to solidify it in my own mind.  It should
be mutually beneficial.  I’d like to also show this not so much as a nicely curated tutorial, but to also show the difficulties
I faced along the way.  Maybe I’ll overlook something really basic, or spend an hour debugging something that was completely 
obvious to everyone else but me.</p>

<p>This also serves as a way to track my progress too.  I think it’ll be cool to look back on this and see where I started and 
where I’ve come, whenever that may be.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I’ll post the most advanced tutorials or the most technical things compared to some other people in the devblog 
space, but hopefully you get something out of this blog.</p>

<p>I also tend to be verbose when I write things out but hopefully that won’t get too much in the way.  I’ll try to organize
everything somewhat neatly so you can skip any exposition or background info if you really want to.  I think it’s 
important though (and I just enjoy writing about programming as a whole).</p>

<p>I’ve got a lot of cool ideas for this blog and I’m hoping to update it regularly.   It always feels nice to have something
to work on, even if nobody really reads it.</p>

<p>If anyone is curious, I write all of my posts using emacs and org-mode.  It’s great for writing things out and exporting
to HTML or markdown.</p>

<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>I originally started programming in C++ in 2016 when I took some introductory CS classes in Community College while pursuing a some gen-ed requirements 
for a math degree.  Eventually I dropped the math degree and decided that I would do what I really wanted to do, linguistics.
I transferred to Boston University to study linguistics and was happy with that until I discovered programming during my senior year.
I started to program in Python in hopes of taking advantage of my new gaming laptop (I wanted to use it for something more productive than
gaming) and found that you can do so many cool things with Python.  During my C++ classes, I spent a year listening to dry lectures read 
verbatim from learncpp.com.  There was never any real push to build anything useful in the classes, it was mostly dry lectures about concepts
nobody really understood well enough to put to any use.  It’s difficult to know why a pointer exists or what it’s used for if you’re never given
anything to illustrate why it’s necessary.  Discovering Python and all the various libraries showed me that there was a lot of really cool things
you could do with programming.  I made a cool GUI tool, some fun web scraper bots, and played around with some different APIs.  That experience of
rediscovering CS and programming was so much fun and I spent just about all my time after class working on my different programming projects. From
that point on, I knew I was hooked and I knew that this was what I wanted to do, whether I was paid or not, I’d do it.</p>

<p>I picked up C around December 2019 after receiving ‘The C Programming Langauge’ for christmas.  Since then, C has become the main langauge I write my
projects in just because it always feels good to write something in C.  There’s a real sense of being in control that I didn’t get when working with 
Python. I’ve also started to play around a bit with Rust since I’d like to know at least one modern and recently created language.
I’m also fascinated with Haskell and functional programming, but every time I’ve started to learn some Haskell, I’ve been pretty intimidated by it all.
I’m excited to get more into Rust and start building things with it.  So far, it seems like a very cool language with some elements of Haskell and the
speed/control of C without being too unsafe.</p>

<p>Some other biographical information:  My other major interest (if it wasn’t already obvious) is linguistics and languages.  I love learning languages
and I’m always interested to talk to anyone that speaks a different language.   Along with my linguistics major, I studied Russian and Japanese, which
I would consider to be my two main foreign languages.  I took Latin in my senior year just for fun and I’m also interested in learning French in the 
future (mainly to see the development from Latin to French and see how much carries over).</p>

<p>Along with that, my favorite bands are Radiohead, AJJ, and probably Talking Heads.  I also really love classical, mostly organ music and contrapunal 
keyboard pieces.</p>
