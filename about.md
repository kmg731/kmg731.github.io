# About this blog

Hello!  This is my own personal blog that I use to keep track of all the programming stuff I do.  

Most of the posts on here will concern project diaries and things that I find interesting in Computer Science.  From
time to time, I may also post about topics relating to translation, linguistics and language learning.  I really love
learning languages and I think it's alwasy cool to learn more about how they work, or the interesting things that they
each have.  My biggest goal with this is to just document the stuff I'm working on or interested in at a given time.
I'm always interested in a lot of things and I hope this will help me organize and refine the stuff I like to do. 

My main goal is to teach but I'd like to show what kind of process I go through when I work on these projects. 
It's useful to have someone just explain how to do something but I think it's just as useful to see what someone found 
interesting/difficult when making something.  It shows that we all make mistakes and don't really know everything 
when we first start on something.  I'll usually talk about what I'm unsure about when I start a project or what I 
might have to look up.  I'll try to document the errors and bugs that I run into and generally how I approached the 
project.

I do tend to be verbose when I write things out but hopefully that won't get too much in the way.  I'll try to organize
everything somewhat neatly so you can skip any exposition or background info if you really want to.  I think it's 
important though (and I just enjoy writing about it). 

I've got a lot of cool ideas for this blog and I'm hoping to update it regularly.   It always feels nice to have something
to work on, even if nobody really reads it.

If anyone is curious, I write all of my posts using emacs and org-mode.  It's great for writing things out and exporting
to HTML or markdown.  I'd rather just stick with the org-mode formatting I'm familiar with and let org-mode handle
the markdown formatting. 

# About me

I'm a hobbyist programmer and I started taking programming seriously around September 2019.
Unfortunately, this was in my last semester of senior year, so there was no way I could take any real CS classes 
or change my major in that time.  I do wish I could have majored in CS, but I also know it would not have been nearly
as fun as I imagine it to be and, with the way self-taught devs can work in CS fields, I'm happy with the way everything
worked out.  I originally took some CS classes in Community College in 2017, but the professor's lectures were read
verbatim from learncpp.com or something like that.  They were dry, boring and never really taught how code could be 
used to do really cool (and sometimes really stupid) things.  Those classes were one year of what is usually covered
in a typical university level freshman 1st semester course.  It covered basic C++ through OOP.  The curve saved me in 
that class and is the only reason I ended both semesters with a B.

I'd say my main programming language is C.  I picked it up a few months after I began Python.  It seemed like a real
departure from what Python was all about.  Where Python lets you do just about anything syntactically, C is much more
direct in what you can and can't do.  I like that a lot.  Python is great in how easy it is to do complex things, but
there is a real joy that comes from building something in C.
I'm also interested in newer langauges like Haskell, Rust, and Go.  I haven't started working much in any one of those, 
but when I do I'll be sure to record it here.  I've got some plans to write about my experiences after playing around
in the Rust book, along with some other plans to write about trying to wrap my head around Haskell.
I'd also love to play around in eLisp but that's been a bit intimidating.

On another note, languages have been the subject I've been interested in longer than any other.  Ever since I was a kid, 
I've always been fascinated by the way other people can read, write, and speak.  My interest didn't really take off until 
I took Chinese in high school (Middle school had language classes, but I wasn't really interested in taking French or 
Spanish).  During this time, I also studied Japanese on my own and learned it to fluency within a few years (I'd really 
like to write some articles about Japanese grammar and translation becuase it really is fascinating).  After that, around
2016, I decided to pick up Russian since I'd lost my taste for Japanese at that time.  I went on to minor in Russian 
language and literature in University and I'd say I can read Russian lit with some confidence.  Speaking is a different
story though, the nervousness you get from speaking a second language in front of a native speaker, combined with the 
difficulty of speaking Russian makes for a very difficult time to practice speaking.
