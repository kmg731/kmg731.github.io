  <div class="post">
    <p>Hello!  This is the first post on my blog.  I’ve got lots of cool projects planned that should be fun to read about.
I’m still playing around with the HTML/CSS of this site and the layout may change a bit in the next few weeks. There
are still some bugs I want to work out before I start posting regularly, but the actual content will be on the way
in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve been able to get everything to play nicely so far.  I switched from hosting this on Blogger to Github pages and
I’m loving the functionality and control that jekyll provides for blogs.  Everything seems to be working nicely (except
for one minor issue with markdown exporting in org-mode).</p>

<p>I will expand on everything here a bit more in the about section and go into more detail on my philosophy for this
but the quick-and-dirty of it is that in each post I hope to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Teach the reader about whatever it is that I’m trying to accomplish to the best of my ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Show the real side of it, not just the fancy polished tutorial side.  I want to document all the things that I
  struggled with or the things which might not have come so quickly to me.  I’ll walk through all the challenges
  that I faced in any given problem and try to offer the best solution I came up with to solve it. Each post won’t 
  be as much of a “how-to” guide, but more of a journal-type entry of how everything came to be.  I’ll show any
  revisions I might have made to something, what I knew and didn’t know at the start of the project, and how 
  everything progressed from start to finish.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I also tend to get a bit verbose when I start writing things, so these posts might be a bit long but I hope the 
information is worth the length.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
