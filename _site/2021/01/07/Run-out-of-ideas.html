    <h1 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the problem?</h1>

<p>In the past few months, I’ve struggled with, what I’d call, code block (not the IDE).  It’s a phenomenon that is known
to most as writer’s block or art block.  I would think most don’t believe that programmers would experience this kind
of creative block.  We’ve seen romantic images of the downtrodden writer or painter suddenly finding their muse and 
being inspired to create a masterpiece, but the idea of someone sitting in an office chair staring at a blank emacs screen
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf("Hello World");</code> mocking them is not nearly as romantic.  I’m not really here to start a debate on the 
public perception of creativity in STEM fields; I can only write about my experience with the matter so more people
can learn about it.  I’ll be speaking about this in terms of programming but just know this applies to any hobby you 
could think of, be it baking, gardening, woodworking, or chemical engineering.  They all have this problem</p>

<p>This code block (as I’ll call it) started after I finished my summer course.  For weeks I’d had all of my projects 
assigned to me and had been told exactly what I needed to do.  It’s nice to have that.  Rather than trying to think
of new ideas, you always have them handed to you.  There’s always a solution to the problem, you always have someone
there to answer your questions, and it’s all a decenlty well-manicured procedure.<br />
When I finished the class, more than anythig, I was tired.  I’d been working for seven weeks straight and, while it
was not always hard, the last week was exhausting.  I decided that I would take a break for a week or two and that
some programming idea would just naturally occur to me.</p>

<p>That would not be the case and what followed was a 3-4 month programming drought.</p>

<p>I think the worst thing about this whole experience was having the desire to program something, but not having the
ability, concentration or motivation to actually program something.  I would try to commit to a project, start a 
tutorial series on that project, then quickly get discouraged because I felt more like a copy-paste with thoughts 
instead of someone that was <em>creating</em> something.  Watching tutorials are great, don’t get me wrong, it’s just that
copying code from a tutorial 1:1 never feels very good when that’s all you can do.</p>

<p>After many failed attempts at different projects, I began to doubt that I’d ever get out of this.  Was I just 
fundamentally broken and doomed to be uncreative my entire life?  Was everything I’d done up to this point just
a farce and, now faced with <em>real</em> programming, I’m actually not up to snuff?  It seemed insurmountably hard to
overcome this.  Was I just supposed to wait until it worked itself out?  In a way, yes.  That’s exactly what I 
did.</p>

<h1 id="what-can-you-do">What can you do?</h1>

<p>If you’re going through this right now, I don’t think there’s anything I can say to guarantee that you get over this. 
The best thing I can do is try and say something that maybe hasn’t been said before or explain my advice a bit better.</p>

<p>Most of the articles you can find on the topic will give very general and somewhat unhelpful advice.  They’ll say things
like “solve a problem with your code,” “follow a programming tutorial,” “build something simple,” or “learn something
new.”  None of this advice is necessarily bad, it’s just very unhelpful for solving any problem.  Each of these pieces
of advice are completely valid and helpful when you actually know what you want to do but utterly fail when you have 
no idea what you want to do.</p>

<p>“Solve a problem with your code” assumes you have a problem that needs solving. I can’t think of a time where I had a 
problem to solve and also didn’t know what to code.  “Having a problem to solve” is about the same as saying “Have 
ideas for things you want to program.”</p>

<p>“Follow a programming tutorial” assumes that you haven’t been doing that already.  The “project based approach” 
that this piece of advice is going for <em>is</em> the perfect way to learn to code but when you can’t think of anything
to code, the last thing you want to do is blindly follow a tutorial.  There’s no real ingenuity or creativity that
goes into just following along with a tutorial series.  On top of that, following a tutorial for something very 
new and complicated might make you feel worse than before.  You’re already dealing the feeling that you know 
nothing and everything is complicated so the last thing you’d want to do is add something even <em>newer</em> and
<em>more complicated</em> on top of that.</p>

<p>“Build something simple” is the opposite of “follow a programming tutorial.”  It’s a very vague piece of advice
that doesn’t really explain itself.  For example, if I’m going through a programming drought where I feel 
I’ve got no creativity but want to at least create something that makes me think, would the best thing really be
to make something so simple that it’s not a challenge?  What’s the point in building something so simple that it
takes barely any effort?  When I tried this, it only reassured me that 1. I can’t really do anything advanced or
technical and 2. I’m not getting anything out of it.  What is there to learn or gain from doing something so simple?</p>

<p>And finally, “learn something new.”  This might be the most unhelpful.  It’s in the same vein as “follow a 
programming tutorial,”  which doesn’t really work when you feel like you can’t do anything.  My own problem with 
this was that I wanted to learn more about one thing rather than learning one more thing.  I wanted to dive deeper
into C, not learn something entirely new. And, even if I did learn something new, I would be starting from the same
basic steps that I’m familiar with.</p>

<p>No, the solution that worked for me came in a few steps.  Simplify, rewrite, and supplement.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Simplify</span>: This is different from “build something simple.” Simplify means to calm down a bit and build something 
that you know you can build or learn something using the easiest and most available method.  The program or topic
itself might be very complicated, but you shouldn’t make it any more complicated than it has to be.  One of the things 
that I picked up when I started working more with C was the constant desire to do <em>everything</em> myself.  Instead of using 
a library for something, I’d want to write it out myself.  An example of this:  When I wanted to make a website, 
rather than finding a hosting platform and some premade HTML/CSS template, I wanted instead learn the entire LAMP
stack, write my own locally hosted webserver and create my website from scratch.  It was a mess.  I had no idea where
to start and became quickly overwhelmed with all the new information.  This was not just for a website, this was for
every project I could think of.  If I were to play around with AI/ML at that time, I’d insist that I write my own ML
code from scratch in C rather than just use TensorFlow or something.  The first simple project that I made was a 
character sheet creator for Cyberpunk 2020.  I wrote it all in Python and connected it to Pillows to output the 
information onto a character sheet.  It even had a little terminal-type system for setting character skills.  It 
wasn’t completely simple, but I did it in a way that was much more simple than if I had tried to go all out and do
it in C from the start.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Rewrite</span>:  An easy way to find something to do is to go back and rewrite previous projects.  This was especially
easy for me since I had a lot of projects originally written in (very messy) python that I wanted to port over to C.
It’s a nice initial step since I’m guaranteed to know how everything works.  The challenge and creativity comes when
you start cleaning things up.  If you’re porting the project to another language, you might find that something very
simple in one language is much different in another.  It’s a great little free project idea and it’ll show you how 
far you’ve come since writing those first few projects.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Supplement_</span>:  What I mean by substitute is that you’ve got to find something that you can do besides programming
that is still about programming.  For me, this was starting my devblog and making tutorials on my older projects.<br />
Rather than just thinking of what would be practical for me to use, I began thinking of what would be fun to write
about.  I picked things that I already knew and wrote about how to make them, what the process was like, and the 
difficulties I ran into along the way.  I’ve always loved talking about and teaching the things I’m interested in
and just writing about the stuff I’ve done is a great way to keep your creativity going.</p>

<p>Looking back on the whole experience, I would say that I learned a lot from it and I’m better off because of it.<br />
The biggest advantage that came out of this is that my motivation and enthusiasm is at an all time high.  I feel 
the same enthusiasm I felt when I first started programming, but it’s better because I have actual knowledge and 
experience to make cooler and cleaner things.  I’m having fun again.  I also feel like I’m immune to it in the future.
Now that I’ve been through it once, I know that I can get through it again and I’m better equipped for it if it comes
again.  It’s all very exciting and this is the first time I’ve really felt like I’ve made some progress in learning
to program.</p>

<p>There’s a great article I read just before I got out of this drought that I think helped me a bit.  It seems somewhat
well known amongst programmers, it’s <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/">Why learning to code is so damn hard</a>.  It’s a great article that details the 
process of learning to code, going from the initial upswing to realizing that you don’t really know that much, to
realizing you <em>really</em> don’t know anything, to getting back on your feet and actually moving forward.  I think the 
advice for how to get out of the “Desert of despair” falls into my “mostly useless advice category” (It’s written more
as a prophylactic and assumes you’re not currently in the “Desert of Despair,” hopefully I’ve helped to make up for
what that article lacks).  It’s impressive how well that article parallels starting any new hobby.  There’s always
that first initial upswing when you start learning something new and the real test comes after that first burst of 
motivation wears off and you have to face the full scope of the hobby.  The trick to getting through all of it is
to just stick with it and try your best to get through the worst parts because, once you do, the real fun lies on the
other side.</p>
